"An Truly Inclusive News App"

1/ According to the 2012 census,
21% of #SriLanka can't read සිංහල.
70% can't read English
74% can't read தமிழ்.

Hence, most of SriLanka can't read
most of the news published in SriLanka.

https://nuuuwan.github.io/news_lk_app
is a baby-step to fix this problem.

2/ #NewsLKApp presents news from multiple source,
along with සිංහල, தமிழ் and English translations.

For example, this is what news published in தமிழ் looks like in සිංහල, and vice versa.
